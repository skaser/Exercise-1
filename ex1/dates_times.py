# otherwise.

# Define a function named how_long that takes two datetime objects dt and ref
# where ref is the reference datetime, calculates the difference between them and
# returns the difference as a string formatted like:
# "01 days, 01 minutes, 01 seconds until 2000-12-31 15:59:59"
# If ref is before dt then use 'since' instead of 'until'
