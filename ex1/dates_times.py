Exercises for using the datetime and the calendar module
'''

# Define a function named last_of_month that takes an argument dt of type date
# and returns a date object representing the last day of the month dt was in.

# Define a function named feed_the_gremlin which takes a time object as an
# argument. It should return False between midnight and 6:30AM and True
# otherwise.

# Define a function named how_long that takes two datetime objects dt and ref
# where ref is the reference datetime, calculates the difference between them and
# returns the difference as a string formatted like:
# "01 days, 01 minutes, 01 seconds until 2000-12-31 15:59:59"
# If ref is before dt then use 'since' instead of 'until'
