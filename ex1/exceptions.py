######################
# Raising Exceptions #
######################

# Use the function search_n from the functions module inside a new function
# also named search_n. The function should do the same as functions.search_n
# but if the variable is not found in the list then raise a ValueError.

########################
# Excepting Exceptions #
########################

# Define a function called safe_divide which takes two arguments and divides
# the first by the second. This function should handle exceptions that might
# occur print out what went wrong and return None if no results could be
# computed.
