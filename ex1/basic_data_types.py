Basic examples about creation of variables with different data types
'''


# define a string variable named a with the value 'my first string'
a = 'my first string'

# define two variables width and height with values 23.5 and 18.2
width = 23.5
height = 18.2

# create a list containing the three variables you just created in the order
# you created them. Assign this list to the variable with name l
l = [a, width, height]

# create a dictionary d. The keys should be the variable names you just created.
# The values will be the actual values of the variables.
d = {'a' : a, 'width' : width, 'height' : height, 'l' : l}
