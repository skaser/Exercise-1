'''
In this module you will define several functions.

Please document your functions according to
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt
'''

# Example so that you can see a passing test
def f():
    """Returns the string 'success'
    """
    return "success"

##############################
# Basic function definitions #
##############################

# Define a function named add that takes two numbers and returns the sum.
def add(a,b):
	return a+b
	
# Define a function named to_tuple that takes three arguments and returns a
# tuple of these three arguments.

def to_tuple(a,b,c):
	return (a,b,c)

# Define a function named check5 that checks if a number is greater than 5 and
# returns True or False.
def check5(n):
	if n > 5:
		return True
	else:
		return False

# Define a function named check_n that check is a number is greater than n. The
# number should be the first argument and n the second
def check_n(i,n):
	if i > n:
		return True
	else:
		return False


#########
# LISTS #
#########

# Define a function named check_list that takes two arguments. The first
# argument is a list of numbers and the second argument is the number n to
# compare against. The function should return a list with equal length as the
# input list containing for each number in the original list either True or
# False if the number was greater than or equal to n.
def check_list(list,n):
	result = [x >= n for x in list]
	return result

# Define a function named check_list_nth that does the same as check_list but
# uses every nth element of the input list (including the first one). You will
# need a third input argument.
def check_list_nth(list,n,step):
	result = [x >= n for x in list[0::step]]
	return result

# Define a function named add_new_list that takes two inputs. A list l and a
# second variable x to add to the list. Return a new list containing x as the
# last element without modifying the original list.
def add_new_list(l,x):
	newl = l.copy()
	newl.append(x)
	return newl

# Define a function named remove_nth that takes a list and removes every nth
# element (including the first one). Use a keyword named nth to set the default
# value for nth to 2.
def remove_nth(list,nth=2):
	newl = list.copy()
	del newl[0::nth]
	return newl

# Define a function named search_n that takes a list and a variable x and
# searches for x in the list. If the variable is found return the index of the
# variable in the list and the variable. Otherwise use None for both return
# values
def search_n(list,x):
	if x in list:
		return(list.index(x), x)
	else:
		return(None,None)

################
# Dictionaries #
################

# Define a function named args_to_dict that takes three arguments and returns a
# dictionary with the position of the argument as the key (starting at 0) and
# the argument as the value.
def args_to_dict(a,b,c):
	return {0:a,1:b,2:c}

# BONUS: Write a function named args_to_dict_general that does the same for any
# number of arguments
def args_to_dict_general(*args):
	d = {}
	i = 0
	for arg in args:
		d[i] = arg
		i+=1
	return d
	
# Define a function named lists_to_dict that takes two lists of equal lenght
# named keys and values and builds a dictionary out of them.
def lists_to_dict(keys,values):
	return dict(zip(keys,values))
	
# Define a function named search_list that takes two lists a and b. The
# function searches for all elements of b in list a. The return value should be
# a dictionary containing the index of the found element of b in list a and the
# value of the found element. If nothing was found then return an empty
# dictionary.
def search_list(a,b):
	d = {}
	for x in a:
		if x in b:
			d[a.index(x)] = x
	return d
			
# Define a function named dict_to_string that takes a dictionary and a
# separator string. The function should only take elements out of the
# dictionary whose value is a string and then return a single string containing
# the strings stored in the dictionary seperated by the separator string.
# Return an empty string if there are no strings in the dictionary.
def dict_to_string(d,string):
	output = ' '
	for x in d.values():
		if type(x) == str:
			output += x + string
	return output[1:len(output)-1]
	
# Define a function named classify_by_type which takes a list l and returns a
# dictionary d. The d must have the keys 'int' and 'str' which contain the
# elements out of l that have this type. Elements that do not fit one of these
# two types should be stored in a list under the key 'others'
